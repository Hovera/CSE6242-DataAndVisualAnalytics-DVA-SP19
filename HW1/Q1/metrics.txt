Average node degree: 2.29
A node’s degree is the number of edges it has. If one movie has many degrees it means it has a lot of similar movies.  On average a movie has about 2.29 connections with others.

Diameter of the graph: 9
The diameter is the longest graph distance between any two nodes in the network. The two most distant nodes in my graph has a distance of 9.

Average path length: 2.87 
On average, there’s a graph-distance of 2.87 between all pairs of nodes. Note that connected nodes have graph distance 1.
